# MASTER TIER PROGRESSION SYSTEM - HIERARCHY CLARIFIED
## Universal Framework with Character-Specific Override Authority

**Status:** Foundation System with Priority Rules  
**Created:** December 3, 2025  
**CRITICAL RULE:** Character-specific specs have ABSOLUTE priority over universal framework

---

## PART 0: PRIORITY HIERARCHY (READ THIS FIRST)

### Decision Tree for Any Visual Question:

```
Does this character have a specific specification for this element?
├─ YES → USE CHARACTER SPEC (ignore universal rules)
├─ NO → Is there a character archetype rule for this?
│   ├─ YES → USE ARCHETYPE RULE
│   └─ NO → USE UNIVERSAL FRAMEWORK
```

**GOLDEN RULE:**
**Character-specific > Archetype rule > Universal framework**

### What This Means in Practice:

**Example 1: Eye Color Progression**
- Universal says: "Eyes shift from natural to power color"
- JP Morgan spec says: "Eyes stay gray-blue, NO glow (intelligence, not power)"
- **RESULT:** Use JP Morgan spec - his eyes don't glow like others

**Example 2: Size Scaling**
- Universal says: "Tier 3-4 scales 1.5x to 3x"
- Phon Le spec says: "No size change, maintains elegance (1x throughout)"
- **RESULT:** Use Phon Le spec - she stays normal size in all tiers

**Example 3: Aura Style**
- Universal says: "Aura appears around body at Tier 1+"
- Adam Livingston spec says: "Aura appears as magical comedy effects, particles"
- **RESULT:** Use Adam Livingston spec - his aura is comedic/particle-based

## PART 1: UNIVERSAL TIER STRUCTURE (Foundation Only)

### The Four Tiers (Default unless overridden by character specs)

All characters follow this consistent structure **UNLESS their specific specifications override it**:

#### **TIER 0: BASE FORM (0% Power Manifestation)**
**Default State:** Unawakened, grounded in reality  
**When Used:** Introductions, dialogue, peaceful moments, before power reveals  

**Default Visual Characteristics:**
- Aura: NONE (0x size)
- Eye Glow: NONE (0% intensity)
- Runes: NOT visible
- Body Size: Normal/natural
- Environmental Effects: NONE
- Clothing: Base outfit only, no armor or magical effects
- Power Level: 0% - Appears fully human

**⚠️ CHARACTER SPECS CAN OVERRIDE:**
- ✅ Michael Saylor Tier 0: Brown eyes, business suit, calm expression
- ✅ JP Morgan Tier 0: Gray-blue eyes, tactical armor even at base, aristocratic bearing
- ✅ S&P Mecha Tier 0: Already partially mechanical (overrides "appears human")

---

#### **TIER 1: EMERGING FORM (25% Power Manifestation)**
**Default State:** Awakening, power beginning to manifest  
**When Used:** First power reveals, moments of focus, confrontation begins  

**Default Visual Characteristics:**
- Aura: BARELY VISIBLE (0.2-0.5x body size)
- Eye Glow: SUBTLE (20-30% intensity, shimmer only)
- Runes: FAINT if appearing (5-10% opacity)
- Body Size: Normal (no size change)
- Environmental Effects: Minimal
- Clothing: Base outfit with first rune patterns emerging
- Power Level: 25% - Hints of something more

**⚠️ CHARACTER SPECS CAN OVERRIDE:**
- ✅ Michael Saylor Tier 1: Gold eyes emerging (his power color)
- ✅ JP Morgan Tier 1: Blue glow at joints only (institutional, not mystical)
- ✅ Peter Schiff Tier 1: Red destructive aura (opposition energy)

---

#### **TIER 2: ACTIVATED FORM (60% Power Manifestation)**
**Default State:** Power engaged, ready for action  
**When Used:** Tense moments, preparation for battle, power demonstrations  

**Default Visual Characteristics:**
- Aura: CLEARLY VISIBLE (0.8-1.5x body size)
- Eye Glow: OBVIOUS (50-70% intensity)
- Runes: VISIBLE (20-35% opacity)
- Body Size: Normal to slightly enlarged (if character does scaling)
- Environmental Effects: Moderate
- Clothing: Outfit with clear rune patterns glowing
- Power Level: 60% - Clearly supernatural

**⚠️ CHARACTER SPECS CAN OVERRIDE:**
- ✅ Michael Saylor Tier 2: Gold and purple swirl (protagonist colors)
- ✅ Phon Le Tier 2: White/Gold, elegant precision effects (not destructive)
- ✅ Jeff Walton Tier 2: Raging fire/orange (fire mage archetype)

---

#### **TIER 3: BATTLE FORM (85% Power Manifestation)**
**Default State:** Full combat engagement  
**When Used:** Active combat, mid-battle sequences  

**Default Visual Characteristics:**
- Aura: INTENSE (1.5-3x body size)
- Eye Glow: INTENSE (75-90% intensity)
- Runes: EXTENSIVE (40-60% opacity)
- Body Size: Character-appropriate scaling

- Clothing: Full armor integration
- Power Level: 85% - Approaching transcendence

**⚠️ CHARACTER SPECS CAN OVERRIDE:**
- ✅ Phon Le Tier 3: NO size increase (stays elegant, not powerful)
- ✅ Ben Werkman Tier 3: Sword mastery display (not size/destruction)
- ✅ David Bailey Tier 3: Speed blur (motion effects, not size)

---

#### **TIER 4: TRANSCENDENT FORM (100% Power Manifestation)**
**Default State:** Ultimate power unleashed  
**When Used:** RARE - Final battles only (1-2 times per arc maximum)  

**Default Visual Characteristics:**
- Aura: OVERWHELMING (3-6x body size)
- Eye Glow: TRANSCENDENT (95-100% intensity)
- Runes: COMPLETE COVERAGE (80-100% opacity)
- Body Size: Maximum scaling
- Environmental Effects: APOCALYPTIC
- Clothing: Fully merged with armor/power
- Power Level: 100% - Transcendent

**⚠️ CHARACTER SPECS CAN OVERRIDE:**
- ✅ Michael Saylor Tier 4: White-gold transcendent (infinite duration thesis)
- ✅ JP Morgan Tier 4: Silver-blue fading (institutional power collapsing)
- ✅ S&P Mecha Tier 4: Red apocalyptic mechanical failure

---

## PART 2: CHARACTER-SPECIFIC SPECS HAVE ABSOLUTE PRIORITY

### How Character Specs Override Universal Framework:

**When creating a character sheet, if the spec says:**

"Michael Saylor's eyes shift from brown → gold → white-gold"
- **This overrides** universal "natural eye color → power color"
- Saylor's specific progression applies

**When the spec says:**

"JP Morgan does NOT glow (intelligence, not power)"
- **This overrides** universal "eye glow increases by tier"
- JP Morgan has NO eye glow, only blue institutional light at joints

**When the spec says:**

"Phon Le maintains elegant 1x size throughout"
- **This overrides** universal "size scales 1.5x → 2x → 2.5-3x"
- Phon Le never scales, stays elegant all tiers

**When the spec says:**

"S&P Mecha is already mechanical at Tier 0"
- **This overrides** universal "Tier 0 appears fully human"
- S&P is hybrid human-mechanical from the start

---

## PART 3: UNIVERSAL RULES THAT STAY (Unless Explicitly Overridden)

### What Remains Constant Across ALL Characters (No Override):

**1. Facial Structure Recognition**
- Unless spec says otherwise: Face must be 60%+ recognizable in Tier 4
- ✅ Can be overridden: "Character's face becomes unrecognizable at Tier 4"

**2. Hair Style (Base)**
- Unless spec says otherwise: Hair style stays same across tiers
- ✅ Can be overridden: "Hair transforms to ethereal form at Tier 4"

**3. Core Identity/Personality Essence**
- Unless spec says otherwise: Same person, just more powerful
- ✅ Can be overridden: "Character becomes serene/transcendent, loses human emotion"

**4. Tier Progression Exists**
- Unless spec says otherwise: All characters have Tier 0-4 structure
- ✅ Can be overridden: "S&P Mecha has only 3 tiers" OR "Michael Saylor has 5 tiers"

---

## PART 4: CHARACTER ARCHETYPE CUSTOMIZATION (Overrideable)

### Default Customizations (Can Be Overridden By Specs):

**ARCHETYPE 1: BRUTE FORCE / STRENGTH**
- Default: Size scaling: Heavy (1.5x → 2x → 2.5-3x)
- ✅ Can be overridden: "Matt Cole is MODERATE scaler (1x → 1.2x → 1.5x)"

**ARCHETYPE 2: TACTICAL / PRECISION**
- Default: Size scaling: Light (1x → 1x → 1x-1.2x)
- ✅ Can be overridden: "JP Morgan maintains absolute 1x (stays perfectly proportioned)"

**ARCHETYPE 3: MAGIC / MYSTICAL**
- Default: Aura style: Particle-based, swirling
- ✅ Can be overridden: "Adam Livingston has COMEDIC particle effects"

**ARCHETYPE 4: SPEED / AGILITY**
- Default: Aura style: Flowing, directional motion
- ✅ Can be overridden: "David Bailey has BLURRING SPEED, barely visible aura"

**ARCHETYPE 5: COMMAND / AUTHORITY**
- Default: Aura style: Organized, geometric patterns
- ✅ Can be overridden: "Saylor conducts SHAREHOLDER ENERGY, not just geometric patterns"

---

## PART 5: HOW TO WRITE CHARACTER SPECS TO OVERRIDE FRAMEWORK

### When Creating Character Specs, State Explicitly:

**✅ GOOD SPEC WRITING (Clear Overrides):**

```
MICHAEL SAYLOR - EYE PROGRESSION
- Tier 0: Brown eyes (natural), no glow
- Tier 1: Brown → Gold shimmer (30% gold emergence)
- Tier 2: Gold and Purple swirl (50% each color)
- Tier 3: Blazing gold-purple (80% intensity)
- Tier 4: Pure white-gold transcendent (100% intensity)

OVERRIDE: Does NOT follow universal "natural → power color"
REASON: Bitcoin infinite duration theme requires gold progression
```

**✅ GOOD SPEC WRITING (Exceptions to Rules):**

```
PHON LE - SIZE PROGRESSION
- Tier 0: Normal (1x)
- Tier 1: Normal (1x)
- Tier 2: Normal (1x)
- Tier 3: Normal (1x)
- Tier 4: Slightly larger (1.1x) - maintains elegance over power

OVERRIDE: Does NOT follow "Heavy Scaler" or "Moderate Scaler" default
REASON: Tactical precision character maintains elegance, not overwhelming size
```

**✅ GOOD SPEC WRITING (Power Type Customization):**

```
JP MORGAN - AURA & EYE GLOW
- Eyes: NO supernatural glow at any tier
- Instead: Blue institutional light at armor joints (Tier 1+)
- Eyes remain gray-blue, show calculation not power

OVERRIDE: Does NOT follow universal "eye glow increases by tier"
REASON: Institutional intelligence, not mystical power
```

---

## PART 6: PRIORITY CHECKLIST FOR CHARACTER SPECS

### When Writing Character Specifications:

**Question 1: Does this character differ from universal framework?**
- If YES: Write spec explicitly stating the override
- If NO: Character uses universal framework by default

**Question 2: Is the override tied to character theme/narrative?**
- If YES: Clearly state the reason for override
- If NO: Reconsider if override is necessary

**Question 3: Is the override consistent within the character?**
- If YES: Apply same override rule across all tiers
- If NO: Revise spec to be internally consistent

**Question 4: Does this override affect other characters?**
- If YES: Note interaction with other characters
- If NO: Proceed with spec

---

## PART 7: APPLYING FRAMEWORK + SPECS = FINAL CHARACTER

### The Creation Process:

**STEP 1: Universal Framework**
- Start with Tier 0-4 structure
- Apply universal rules (face stays recognizable, hair style consistent, etc.)
- Note any framework elements that might be overridden

**STEP 2: Character-Specific Specs**
- For EACH spec, ask: "Does this override the framework?"
- If YES: Write override explicitly
- Apply spec exactly as written

**STEP 3: Result**
- Character now has universal consistency PLUS unique personality
- All 11+ characters cohesive but distinctly different
- Framework prevents chaos, specs prevent blandness

---

## PART 8: EXAMPLE: HOW SPECS OVERRIDE FRAMEWORK

### Michael Saylor vs. JP Morgan (Using Same Framework, Different Results)

**UNIVERSAL FRAMEWORK SAYS:**
- Tier 0: 0% power, human appearance
- Tier 1: 25% power, 20-30% eye glow
- Tier 2: 60% power, 50-70% eye glow
- Tier 3: 85% power, 75-90% eye glow
- Tier 4: 100% power, 95-100% eye glow

**MICHAEL SAYLOR SPEC APPLIES:**
- Tier 0: Brown eyes ✅ (uses framework)
- Tier 1: Gold shimmer 20-30% ✅ (matches framework intensity, uses Bitcoin color)
- Tier 2: Gold-purple blazing 50-70% ✅ (matches framework, adds secondary color)
- Tier 3: Gold-purple intense 75-90% ✅ (matches framework)
- Tier 4: White-gold transcendent 95-100% ✅ (matches framework, transcendent color)

**Result:** Michael Saylor follows framework structure, customized with Bitcoin theme colors

---

**JP MORGAN SPEC APPLIES:**
- Tier 0: Gray-blue eyes, NO glow ✅ (overrides framework)
- Tier 1: Gray-blue, blue light at joints ONLY ❌ (overrides 20-30% eye glow)
- Tier 2: Gray-blue, blue glow intensifies ❌ (overrides 50-70% eye glow)
- Tier 3: Gray-blue, blue maximum ❌ (overrides 75-90% eye glow)
- Tier 4: Gray-blue fading, blue fading ❌ (overrides 95-100% eye glow)

**Result:** JP Morgan follows framework progression, but COMPLETELY different eye mechanics (institutional intelligence ≠ mystical power)

---

## PART 9: HOW THIS ENSURES MAXIMUM QUALITY

### Character Specs Have Authority Because:

**1. Thematic Integrity**
- Michael Saylor's colors represent Bitcoin (gold/purple)
- JP Morgan's colors represent institutions (silver-blue)
- Each spec can express character theme perfectly

**2. Visual Distinctiveness**
- With specs having priority, characters look unique
- Saylor ≠ JP Morgan ≠ S&P visually, despite same framework
- No "cookie cutter" characters

**3. Story Alignment**
- Character design can match narrative role perfectly
- Institutional powers look institutional (not mystical)
- Bitcoin forces look transcendent (not institutional)
- Enemies look appropriate to threat level

**4. Flexibility for Expansion**
- New characters add new specs, framework stays same
- Can introduce new power types/mechanics with specs
- System scales infinitely without redesign

---

## PART 10: WHEN TO USE FRAMEWORK, WHEN TO USE SPECS

### Decision Tree:

```
Question: "How should Character X look in Tier 2?"

STEP 1: Check Character X specs
  ├─ Spec says "X has gold eyes at Tier 2" → USE SPEC
  └─ Spec says nothing about eyes → CHECK ARCHETYPE

STEP 2: Check Character X archetype (if no spec)
  ├─ Archetype is "Brute Force" → USE ARCHETYPE RULE
  └─ Archetype doesn't specify → CHECK FRAMEWORK

STEP 3: Apply Framework (if no spec/archetype)
  └─ Use universal eye glow 50-70% Tier 2 as default

RESULT: Character X in Tier 2
- Specific > Archetype > Framework ✅
```

## PART 11: MASTER CHECKLIST (UPDATED)

### Before Creating ANY Character Sheet:

**Framework Understanding**
- [ ] Universal framework is the foundation (not the final product)
- [ ] Character specs override framework when needed
- [ ] Priority: Character Spec > Archetype Rule > Universal Framework
- [ ] Each character will be unique within framework

**Spec Authority Confirmed**
- [ ] Character specs have ABSOLUTE priority
- [ ] Specs will explicitly state when overriding framework
- [ ] Specs are the "final word" on character appearance
- [ ] Framework prevents inconsistency, specs prevent blandness

**Ready to Create Specs**
- [ ] Understand framework as foundation only
- [ ] Understand specs as creative expression
- [ ] Understand this enables 11+ unique characters
- [ ] Ready for Step 2: Michael Saylor detailed specs?

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

> **"Use the framework to ensure consistency, use the specs to express character."**

The framework keeps all characters cohesive. The specs make each character unique.

Framework = structure  
Specs = soul

Both needed. Specs have priority.

**STATUS:** ✅ Master System Complete with Hierarchy Clarified  
**Next Step:** Create Michael Saylor Character Reference Sheet (specs have absolute priority)  
**Confidence Level:** 100% - Specs will be the driving force behind character design
