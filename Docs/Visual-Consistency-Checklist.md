## AURA SCALING REFERENCE

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Character Recognition Failure**
- Facial features change significantly between tiers
- Hair color/style inconsistent
- Wrong power level for scene
- Personality completely different

❌ **Color Palette Errors**
- Matt Cole with white/purple aura (wrong - orange/gold only)
- Phong Le with orange/red aura (wrong - white/gold only)
- Enemy using character colors (should be red/black)
- Background too bright/distracting

❌ **Scaling Problems**
- Aura not scaling progressively
- Eye glow appearing suddenly instead of gradually
- Size changes not matching tier specifications
- Shareholder army inconsistent visibility

❌ **Style Inconsistencies**
- Anime art style suddenly changes
- Loss of dramatic lighting
- Particle effects disappear
- Composition becomes static

❌ **Tier Mismatches**
- Tier 3 body with Tier 1 eyes
- Tier 2 aura with Tier 4 ground destruction
- Tier 4 size with minimal suit runes
- Mixed power levels within same character

## QUICK VERIFICATION BEFORE FINAL

### 30-Second Check

1. **Character Identity:** Is this unmistakably the right character? (5 sec)
2. **Power Level:** Does tier match intended scene? (5 sec)
3. **Colors:** Are primary colors correct? (5 sec)
4. **Style:** Does it look like Solo Leveling quality? (5 sec)
5. **Details:** Any obvious errors or inconsistencies? (5 sec)

**If ANY answer is "no" - DO NOT USE. Regenerate with corrections.**

## REFERENCE IMAGE ANCHORS

### Use These for Comparison

**Matt Cole Baseline:** [generated_image:401] - Base Form
- Default facial features
- No effects/aura
- Professional CEO appearance
- Reference point for all other tiers

**Phong Le Baseline:** [generated_image:405] - Base Form
- Default facial features
- No effects/aura
- Strategic CEO appearance
- Reference point for all other tiers

**When creating any tier, always mentally compare to baseline:**
- Same face? ✓
- Same hair? ✓
- Same core appearance? ✓
- Only effects/size/glow different? ✓

---

## FEEDBACK LOOP

After each panel generation:

1. **Compare to baseline reference image** - Are features preserved?
2. **Check against tier specifications** - Does it match documented specs?
3. **Validate against visual rules** - Are consistency rules followed?
4. **Assess art quality** - Does it match Solo Leveling standard?
5. **Log any deviations** - Document what needs adjustment

If 3+ items fail, regenerate with corrections before proceeding.

---

**Use this checklist for EVERY panel generated in the new space.**

**Goal:** 100% consistency across all 22-30 panels, maintaining visual quality throughout the entire narrative arc.

**Key Mantra:** "Same face, different power. Consistent character, escalating scale."
